module Slack
  # Routes different types of Slack interactions to appropriate handlers
  #
  # IMPORTANT: SLACK MODAL BEHAVIOR NOTES
  # ====================================
  #
  # Slack only sends `view_closed` events in specific cases:
  # - When the modal is closed programmatically via API
  # - Due to certain system events or timeouts
  # - NOT when users click the "Cancel" button or close button (X)
  #
  # When users click "Cancel" or "X":
  # - Slack simply closes the modal client-side
  # - No event is sent to your endpoint
  # - This is by design - Slack assumes "Cancel" means "do nothing"
  # - No server interaction is needed for user-initiated cancellations
  #
  # Therefore, we only handle:
  # - view_submission: When users submit forms (click primary action button)
  # - block_actions: When users interact with buttons, dropdowns, etc.
  #
  # We do NOT handle view_closed events because they're unreliable for user actions.
