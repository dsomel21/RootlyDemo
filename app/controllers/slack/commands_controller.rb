class Slack::CommandsController < Slack::BaseController
  # POST /slack/commands
  #
  # Handles the `/rootly` slash command from Slack.
  #
  # NOTE:
  # Slack only lets us define one slash command here: `/rootly`.
  # Therefore, `params[:command]` will always be "/rootly".
  # We parse subcommands (e.g. "declare <title>", "resolve") from `params[:text]`.
  #
  # FLOW:
  # Slack user types `/rootly declare "Something"` â†’ we parse `declare "Something"` from params[:text]

  def receive
    # Parse command text to determine action
    text = params[:text].to_s.strip

      title = $1.strip
